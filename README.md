# Grand Circus Alumni Meetup Code Challenge #1

## Tommy's Challenge!

Remember those annoying math problems from school?

"Starting in Chicago, a train is going 45 MPH east. A second train is going west at 60 MPH starting in Detroit. Where do they collide, assuming they travel in a straight line toward each other?"

I want you to write an algorithm in the language of your choice to solve this type of problem. Grab inputs from the user, specifically the speed and start point of each train (alternatively you can just say they're X distance apart).

The goal is to determine when and at what point the trains collide.

### Let's do this!

This challenge can be completed using both front end and back end technologies.  For the front end students, feel free to craft a gorgeous interface!  Dazzle us with modals, transitions and any other goodies you may desire.  Be sure to practice your git skills:  initialize a repo and commit your changes as you work.
